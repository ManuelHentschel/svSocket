## Installation

### Latest stable version

The latest stable version of **svSocket** can simply be installed from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org):

```r
install.packages("svSocket")
```


### Development version

Make sure you have the **devtools** R package installed:

```r

```

Use `install_github()` to install the **svSocket** package from Github (source from **master** branch will be recompiled on your machine):

R should install all required dependencies automatically, and then it should compile and install **svSocket**.

## Note to developers

This package used to be developed on R-Forge in the past. However, the latest [R-Forge version](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/sciviews/) was moved to this Github repository on 2016-03-18 (SVN version 569). **Please, do not use R-Forge anymore for SciViews development, use this Github repository instead.**
