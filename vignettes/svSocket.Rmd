The SciViews **svSocket** package provides a stateful, multi-client and preemptive socket server. Socket transaction are operational even when R is busy in its main event loop (calculation done at the prompt). This R socket server uses the excellent asynchronous socket ports management by Tcl, and thus, it needs a working version of Tcl/Tk (>= 8.4) and of the **tcltk** R package.
